# Open Semantic Lab

Open Semantic Lab is a holistic web platform that can capture all data and ideas and link them precisely (semantically/ontology-based) - no matter if it' s inventory (LIMS), lab notes (ELN), procedures (SOPs) or research (KB). 
Each piece of information can also be machine-read, blockchain-signed and written to automatically transfer (Lab 4.0) and analyze (AI) measurement data. 
As an open system, Open Semantic Lab can be easily adapted with little to none programming knowledge without losing the uniform structure. 
In this way, we can contribute to everyone's knowledge individually and yet in a standardized way.

## Which problems are addressed?

### Loss of knowledge
Most of the knowledge generated in industry and science is irrevocably lost because we lack suitable tools for sustainable and complete documentation.

### AI accessible data structure
In addition, generated data can only be structured and made accessible to AI with a great deal of additional effort. 

## What are the core components?
* MediaWiki, extented with Semantic MediaWiki and various other existing extensions
* The Mediawiki extension ['OpenSemanticLab'](https://github.com/OpenSemanticLab/mediawiki-extensions-OpenSemanticLab)
* Ontologies, especially the [General Process Ontology](https://github.com/General-Process-Ontology/ontology)
* A Graph-Datebase, currently blazegraph
* A Time-Series-Database, currently TimeScaleDB
* JupyterHub as Workflow-Environment
* Node-RED as Dashboard-Solution
* A [Python Toolset](https://github.com/OpenSemanticLab/Tools)
* Connectors to platforms like [IDS](https://internationaldataspaces.org/), [PMD](https://material-digital.de/), etc. (tbd)
